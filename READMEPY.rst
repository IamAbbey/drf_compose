DRF Compose is a Python package for defining and quick starting Django
Rest Framework projects. With DRF Compose, you use a JSON or YAML file
to configure your DRF application. Then, with a single command, you get
to generate your DRF project code using all the specified configuration
from your compose file. To learn more about all the features of DRF
Compose, see the list of features below.

DRF Compose is aimed at making the process of starting a DRF project
quick and fun - giving you a development head start experience - while also preventing 
any frustration caused by the inability to quick start an API.

Installing
==========

Install and update using
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install -U drf_compose

Usage
=====

Using DRF Compose is basically a two-step process:

-  Define your application in a drf-compose.json file.
-  Run drf-compose and the DRF compose command generates a ready to use
   DRF project code.

Command options overview and help

You can also see this information by running drf-compose --help from the command line.
